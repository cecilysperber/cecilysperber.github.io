In the Spring of 2025 I took a Quantitative Reasoning class based in R. I wrote some code and did some cool data science. Here is a collection of projects from this course.

[Building a Project Website](https://cecilysperber.github.io/)

-   Created a new repository connecting RStudios and my GitHub account
-   Created new files, staged them, commit them, and pushed them to connect with the repository
-   Created this entire website!

[COVID-19 Data Analysis](https://cecilysperber.github.io/csu-ess-lab3/lab-03.html)
