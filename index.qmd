I am an emerging environmental professional focused on applying knowledge and skills to address global ecological challenges. I am in the process of obtaining my Bachelor of Science in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability with a minor in Ecological Restoration. My professional experience includes working with organizations and charities dedicated to sustainability and community. I have a passion for restoring and preserving our natural environments. I believe that gaining a deeper understanding of ecosystems is essential for addressing today’s environmental challenges, and I’m eager to play a role in developing sustainable solutions that support both nature and communities.
